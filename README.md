# Final_Year_Project
Repository for Final Year Project

This Repository is for my final year project which is a Medical Diagnosis app coded using Blazor Webassembly.
The app has to be able to diagnose an illness based upon user inputted symptoms and be able to show the locations of the nearest hospitals along with directions to them.

Packages/API used:
GoogleMapsApi: The google maps API key uses the Maps JavaScript API to call the map to the page, the places library within the it to call a Nearby Search Request to show nearby hospitals to the user and the Geolocation feature to center the map on the users location using the devices location services
